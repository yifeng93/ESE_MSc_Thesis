The raw data is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club), which contains the period from 2007 to 2018. I only selected the year 2016-2018 due to computing power.  The data has over 150 features originally, the variable description is provided [here](./Data/LCDataDictionary.xlsx) .

## 1.  Data Clean

The source code for this part is provided here &rarr; [Part1_Data_Clean.ipynb](./Code/Part1_Data_Clean.ipynb)

## 2. Data Preparation

After the first stage data clean, I did further feature engineering in this part to prepare different version of data for final model implementation. The source code for this part is provided here. &rarr; [Part2_Data_Preparation_Wrangling.ipynb](./Code/Part2_Data_Preparation_Wrangling.ipynb)

## 3. Models

> All models are applied using several versions of data set to compare the results. E.g., SMOTE and without SMOTE,  with outliers and without outliers.

### 3.1 Logistic Model

Logistic model is provided here &rarr; [Part3_Logistic_Model.ipynb](./Code/Part3_Logistic_Model.ipynb). In this file, I also tried panelized logistic regression(LASSO) to compare the results.
